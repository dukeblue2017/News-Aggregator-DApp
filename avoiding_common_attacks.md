By having all of the logic and variables in one place, there is a lower risk of any kinds of attacks that benefit from calls to external contracts.

There is minimal use of integers in the contract, so there should be at most only minimal concerns with overflow or underflow.

I included a selfdestruct call that can only be called by the contract's owner as a safety valve.

The contract is probably most vulnerable to some reentry attacks, which will need further attention.
